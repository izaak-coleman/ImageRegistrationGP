Image registration on pocket-sized computers 
===========================================================================
This is the central repository for the ICL MCS group project for testing
the image registration capabilities of pocket-sized computers. 

Each subdirectory contains the necessary compilation, run steps and relevant
files for the computers in our comparison. We run comparable functions, 
specifically the Parametric Image Alignment Using Enhanced Correlation 
Coefficient Maximization (Evangedilis and Psarakis, 2008) and a scalar
matrix multiplication across different platforms, but not every comparison
point will be found for every platform. 

Please refer to our final report for further information.
